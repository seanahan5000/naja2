=================================
Old notes from /WORK1.PO/TF.NOTES
=================================

Changes to Professions:
     All characters are more robot-like
     All have fighting skills (how does this effect who can use what equipment?)
     Juicer - make them more real - tied to inorganic and implants
     Cybernate - computer expert/hacker
          - deals with core
          - computer terminals
          - no longer controls a robot
     Androids - Alien life forms/languages/scanners,etc - skills related to xenologist.  Needs new name!!!
     Warrior - specializes in fighting, strategy, tactics, weapons systems (also needs new name)
Limit number of characters in group to 5!!!

Instead of carrying equipment, implant it whenever possible.
Juicer - upgrade his equipment
          - emitting heat/light/energy all separate
               - buy/find the stuff
          - have some form of icon in the characters stats that show these abilities
Androids - scanners implanted
Explains the availability of the ComLink

ENERGY
     - implant equivalent of batteries
     - no longer goes up with rank

DAMAGE
     - some how tied to implants
     - mix with idea of replacing organic parts and repairing/healing wounds

EQUIPMENT
     - can buy any piece of equipment but brain can't always handle it
     - upper and lower reflex, in addition to IQ become brain measuring numbers instead of physical measurements.  Strength would probably be gotten rid of.
          - these numbers go up with rank and provide a way to limit what equipment can be used by what level of character, no matter how many credits they have.
     - robot becomes more of a character - 100% synthetic
          - artificial brain
